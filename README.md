# Hello world

Hi there, this is my presentation.

My name is Milena, live in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

I am a technology lover but, I studied civil engineering for almost three years. I decided to stop and gave myself time to think and be aware of my future. After that, I got my conclusion so, I started to follow tech/dev departments.

Thank you if you read this because it is a short text about me :)
